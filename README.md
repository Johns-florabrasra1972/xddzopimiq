Oh man, Ask Sadece Bir An – where do I even begin? Just stepped out and my backs killing me from those seats, popcorn crumbs still sticking to my shirt. The place was packed and so noisy, I could barely hear myself think... but WOW… what a ride. It's like the movie was trying to plant memories in my head like seeds, growing wild and untamed. 

To think I came outta there feelin’ like a lost echo in a field of words, like a crazy wheat stalk swayin’ in the breeze – that’s how disorienting it was. The scenes were like patches of different crops planted all over my mind, randomly sprouting up every time I close my eyes. I swear, during one scene, it felt like I was just a bug on their cracked window, hanging on for dear life. 

There’s this one part where they're in this intense alleyway chase that echoes under your skin – oh, it’s visceral. Thought my heart was gonna jump out like a rabbit dashing from a fox. > The whole time, my brain kept shouting, you gotta download the movie right after! because I know watching it again is just as inevitable as the sun rising. It's one of those movies, you know? One you gotta chew on like an overripe apple – the type that’s got juice drippin’ down to your elbow.

And the landscape in one scene… gosh, so pretty I wanted to dive into it, like a kid cannonballing into a summer’s river. And the characters, like grains of sand slipping through time’s hourglass, there one minute, gone the next, haunting.

It’s both a chaotic mess and a beautiful masterpiece, like a garden left to its own devices, with flowers and weeds in a waltz. Oh dear, some guy behind kept coughing, no manners, ruining the moment, but even then, I could feel the movie gripping my senses, pulling me back in.

Someone asked if I could get a copy – you must watch the movie at home too in peace, you know? These theater frustrations, like ducks pretending to be swans. But, it’s wormed into my brain, wedges of story stuck in the creases of my thoughts.
